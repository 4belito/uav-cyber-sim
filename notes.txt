TODO:
-Check and possibly improve scalability:
-Send plans through MAVLink (avoid hardcoding in oracle.py and proxy.py scripts)
    -fix: [Errno 111] Connection refused sleeping
-Completely remove the sim_vehicle.py script from the simulator; move the necessary code to custom scripts (proxy.py, sim.py, oracle.py)
-Add collision avoidance and dynamic planning capabilities (old code is commented in vehicle_logic.py and oracle.py)
-Improve collision avoidance — ideally, use ArduPilot’s built-in algorithm or implement a state-of-the-art alternative
