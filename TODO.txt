TODO:
- differentiate remote ID(system  id) from mavlink connection sysid
- organize data collection
- Launch vehicles at any time
- Add support to use different UAV models other than Iris.
- Fix: [Errno 111] Connection refused — sleeping.
- Completely remove the sim_vehicle.py script from the simulator; move necessary code to custom scripts (proxy.py, sim.py, oracle.py).
- Add a parameter for waypoint reach distance, similar to Guided mode.

- Add dynamic planning capabilities (from old code) 
- Improve collision avoidance — ideally, use ArduPilot’s built-in algorithm or implement a state-of-the-art alternative.

- Add more cyber attacks and modulireze the current rid spooing attack
