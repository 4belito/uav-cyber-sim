TODO:

- Check and possibly improve scalability.
- Send plans through MAVLink (avoid hardcoding in oracle.py and proxy.py):

- Fix: [Errno 111] Connection refused — sleeping.
- Completely remove the sim_vehicle.py script from the simulator; move necessary code to custom scripts (proxy.py, sim.py, oracle.py).
- Update simulator logic: launch GCSs first, then have each GCS launch its associated vehicles.
- Make it work with both Gazebo and QGC at the same time (simultaneously)?
- Add a parameter for waypoint reach distance, similar to Guided mode.
- Issue: When the notebook is stopped before QGC finishes, the mission does not appear the next time QGC runs. (Check QGC initialization to fix this.)

- Add collision avoidance and dynamic planning capabilities (some old code is commented out in vehicle_logic.py and oracle.py).
- Improve collision avoidance — ideally, use ArduPilot’s built-in algorithm or implement a state-of-the-art alternative.
- Add support for dynamically spawning different UAV models.
