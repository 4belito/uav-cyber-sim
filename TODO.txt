TODO:
- Check UDP conections( some times some uavs does not complete its mission)

-List of posible cyber attacks
-collect Sensors measurements
-Study GAZEBO Model
- Add support to use different UAV models other than Iris.

- Fix: [Errno 111] Connection refused — sleeping.
- Completely remove the sim_vehicle.py script from the simulator; move necessary code to custom scripts (proxy.py, sim.py, oracle.py).
- Update simulator logic: launch GCSs first, then have each GCS launch its associated vehicles.
- Add a parameter for waypoint reach distance, similar to Guided mode.


- Add collision avoidance and dynamic planning capabilities (some old code is commented out in vehicle_logic.py and oracle.py).
- Improve collision avoidance — ideally, use ArduPilot’s built-in algorithm or implement a state-of-the-art alternative.
